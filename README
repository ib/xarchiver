What is it?
===========
Xarchiver is the ultimate solution for handling archives on Linux and FreeBSD.
It's a Desktop Environment independent archiver frontend. All common archive
types are supported. RPM and DEB packages are handled without their package
managers being installed. Xarchiver only depends on the GTK+ libraries and
utilizes various (un)compressor/(un)archiver command line programs at runtime.
Installation of xdg-utils is optional but installing it will allow Xarchiver
the support to open more file types directly from inside an archive.

How to use it:
=============
Please read the documentation accessible from the Help menu.

===============
./configure                      # (run './configure --help' for more details)
