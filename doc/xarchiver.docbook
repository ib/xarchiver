			<para>
				&app; is a small and lightweight archive manager.
				I developed it to manage archives without depending from a special Desktop Environment
				like KDE or GNOME, so &app; requires only the GTK+ toolkit
				to work. The package <emphasis>xdg-utils</emphasis> is optional.

				<title>Startup</title>
				<para>
					At startup, &app; detects the available installed archivers (tar,rar,zip etc) and the script <emphasis>xdg-open</emphasis> for handling different file types. Since &app; is a frontend (a graphic user interface to the command line executables) it can't create archives whose archiver is not available. For instance if you have the free edition of rar, unrar, &app; can't create rar archives since unrar allows rar archives to be opened, tested and extracted but not to be created.
				</para>
			</section>
			<section id="how_it_works">
				<title>How it works</title>
				<para>
					&app; will run in the background the command line executable of the archiver with the archiver's proper switches to perform the selected operation. If something goes wrong &app; reports the full output of the archiver executable in the command line output window. Starting with release 0.5 the files in the archive can be opened within &app;. The script <emphasis>xdg-open</emphasis> will detect the file type and run the proper application to handle it. If you don't have such script installed in your system (it's found in the xdg-utils package) &app; will recognize HTML, txt and images files only. The Preferences dialog will notify this to you when you click the Advanced section inside it.

				<title>Drag and Drop</title>

					&app; supports drag and drop through the <ulink url="http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/XDS?action=show&amp;redirect=Standards%2FXDS"><citetitle>XDS protocol</citetitle></ulink>. As far as I know only Thunar and Nautilus file managers supports it. Files and directories can be dragged from such file manager's windows to &app; and vice versa. If its window is empty (no archives open) &app; will prompt the user with the <xref linkend="new_dialog"/> asking for the filename and the archive type to be created; after which the dragged files will be added. If the dragged file is a supported archive, &app; will open it instead of prompting the new dialog.

		<title>FAQ</title>
		<section id="faq_1">
			<title>Why are ace archives not supported?</title>
			<para>Because on some strange reasons there is no support on Linux for creating archives, only extraction with unace. When they will develop full support for ace archives I will add it to &app;.
			</para>
		</section>
		<section id="faq_2">
			<title>How can I create an archive with some files password protected and others not?</title>
			<para>First of all choose 'New' and select one of arj, 7zip, rar or zip archive formats and choose 'Add' from the Action menu. Do NOT check "Password" in the Add dialog. Add your files and then reopen the Add dialog again but this time check "Password" and
enter your password. From now on all the files you add to the archive will be password protected.
			</para>
		</section>
		<section id="faq_3">
			<title>Why does &app; emit this error message when handling tar archives?</title>
			<para>&app; is only a frontend which runs the archiver and reports ITS error messages. Most probably you are opening an archive produced with older versions of tar than the one you are currently using or the archive is corrupted.
			</para>
		</section>
		<section id="faq_4">
			<title>Why is the option "Extract with full path" disabled when using the -e switch with tar archives?</title>
			<para>Because GNU tar does not provide a full way to extract files without the directories in which they are contained as the other archivers do. Extraction without path when using the GUI is perfomed with a trick which is not available when using the -e switch from the command line.
			</para>
		</section>
		<section id="faq_5">
			<title>Why does &app; sometimes report errors but the Error messages window is empty?</title>
			<para>Please remember, that &app; is only a frontend. It correctly reads any output from STDOUT or STDERR. Most probably the archiver didn't write anything to those channels even though it exists with an error code.
			</para>
		</section>
		<section id="faq_6">
			<title>Why &app; doesn't allow me to choose the archive self-extracting path as it happens with zip and 7z?</title>
			<para>Because rar and arj executable do not allow to do so. Zip and 7z convertion to self-extracting is made by appending an sfx module to the archive so it's possible to choose a different path.
			</para>
